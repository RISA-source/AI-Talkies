# AI-Talkies

It is just an experimental project where I try to make the AI's talk with maybe different AI or one thread of AI with another thread itself like making agents and such to observe different behaviour and trying to get a proper and more efficient output in different scenarios like coding, idea generation, and more.

I mostly use free API's by gemini or open-router to conduct these experiments so I will also have each company and model properly described according to each use in the files in the above repository.

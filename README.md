# AI-Talkies

It is just an experimental project where i try to make the AI's talk maybe different AI or one thread of AI with another thread itself like making agents and such.

I mostly use free API's by gemini or open-router to conduct these experiments so I will also have each company and model properly described according to each use in the files in the above repository.
